## 3. Resources
### 3.1 Stable Diffusion 3.5 Worker Collection
A collection of the newest family of diffusion models by Stability AI, optimized for RunPod use as serverless workers. Prebuilt images are also available for one click deploy.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important ‚ö†Ô∏è : When using the docker image directly in RunPod, append :dev to the container name.**

```bash
thehunter911/stbldiff3.5-medium-runpod-serverless:dev
```

instead of 

```bash
thehunter911/stbldiff3.5-medium-runpod-serverless
```

due to a RunPod bug.
