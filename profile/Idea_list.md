# Open Source Project Idea List

## 1. LiteGUIAgent
Similar to a web agent, but this would be a VLM-based device control agent that should be able to generalize to computer and Android device control. It can be tested on computer control benchmarks or Android simulators.

## 2. Generative Agent-based modeling

## 3. LLM agent for Embodied AI
